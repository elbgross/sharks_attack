# Shark Attack Injury Analysis

## Danger -O- meter
This project analyzes data on shark attack incidents, focusing specifically on the **injuries sustained** by victims.  
From the dataset, we worked with the injury-related column and developed an **Injury Score**, which assigns a numerical value to the severity of each injury.  

The main goals of this project are:
- To help hospitals **reduce emergency room response time** in the event of shark attacks.  
- To **recommend preventive actions** to the public to minimize the risk of shark-related injuries.  

This repository contains the data processing, analysis, and scoring logic used to generate insights from the shark injury dataset.
